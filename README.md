# Snake Game
A simple Snake game built using Python's `turtle` and `time` libraries.

## Description
This project is a classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. The game utilizes `turtle` for graphics and `time` for managing game speed.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The required libraries are:
- `turtle` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `time` (built-in module)

## Installation
No additional installation is required since both libraries are included with Python by default.

## Usage
Run the Python script using the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```
Replace `main.py` with the actual filename of your Python script if different.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Uses `time.sleep()` to control game speed
- Fun and interactive graphics using `turtle`

## License
This project is open-source and free to use. Modify and distribute as needed.
